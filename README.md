I’m a Product Leader working at the intersection of **GenAI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Agents, Agentic RAG, Feature Stores, and AI Infrastructure**.  
I help teams build AI systems that are **reliable, scalable, cost-efficient, and aligned with real business value**.

### **[Prompt Playbook](https://github.com/PMcoder84/prompt-playbook)** - My personal collection of high-impact prompts that help me think faster, write sharper, and ship better as a Product Manager.
